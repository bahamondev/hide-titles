# Hide titles

A KWin script which hides the window titles when they are maximized.

## Setup

### Build

Just run `make build`. That will create a zip file with plugin contents and rename it to the `.kwinscript` extension.
If you want to manually build the script then:

1. Compress the `contents` folder and the `metadata.desktop` file into a zip
2. Rename the zip to `hide-titles.kwinscript`

### Install

Go to the project folder and run `make install`. That should clean and uninstall previous builds, perform a new build and install the plugin in the system.

If you want to manually install the script:

```sh
plasmapkg2 -t kwinscript -i hide-titles.kwinscript
```

### Uninstall

Run `make uninstall`.

## Features

Removes the window title on:

* New windows that starts maximized.
* Open windows when the user maximized then.
* Open windows that are already maximized, when the plugin is activated.

And never applies on windows that always start without window borders (ie, latte dock, Application Menu widget...).

Bind "Hide Titles" to a screen edge listener to restore the border on the active window (can be re-hidden by exiting and then entering maximized).

To-do list:

* Let the user set up application exceptions.
* Apply the script only in pre-set screens.
